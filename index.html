                <p>Jason Fleming is a Business Systems Analyst at Rust Consulting, Inc. I've spent the past 3 years architecting, configuring, and implementing a cross-functional, process-driven enterprise request management system that facilitates 30,000 service requests annually. I perform project management, business architecture, system architecture, system engineer, and training/support roles on a daily basis. </p>

            </aside>
            <p>The initial system rollout in 2015 was a two week effort including 5 teams in separate departments across the organization. As of January 2019 the system provides 67 unique services that fulfill their client's business needs and meet the demands of external auditors. I'm driven by delivering solutions that increases productivity, communication clarity, and work experience. </p>
            <p>I live in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis with my partner Maren and our amazing daughter Sydney. I play synthesizer and bass guitar, occassionally out in the seedy underbelly of downtown Minneapolis. I enjoy music, art, thinking, and family. </p>
