        <p>My name is Jason Fleming. I have 8 years of Analysis, Process Analysis, System Configuration, and Project Management experience. I decided to join the University of Minnesota bootcamp to learn coding languages.</p>
        <p>I have experience writing some CSS, it is inline, and within the system's default html generator. The generator appers to me as a form that I can drag and drop labels and fields. The "form" is then presented to users in a web application that is further modified by SASS CSS and other default mixinss.</p>
